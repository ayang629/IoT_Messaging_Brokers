On flex and bison / Lex and YACC:
	Lex: Lexicographical Analyzer (A tokenizer)
		In the context of compilers, it creates and parses input into tokens
	YACC: Yet another compiler compiler
		Defines meaning and creates semantics
		Create schematically the entire parse tree that represents your language
	These are the go-to tools for creating new languages
	flex/bison: the upgraded versions of Lex and YACC. We usually use these today

Execution Profiling
	Execution profiling means gathering statistics on how long a process executes particular pieces of code

Concurrency II (Process Synchronization)
	Circular buffer: method of implementing a FIFO queue
		Items are inserted at position "IN" and fetched from position "OUT"
		The buffer wraps around at the endpoints, so the position after N-1 is position 0
	Producer Consumer problem: 
		Consider what happens if two processes have concurrent read-write access to the buffer
		The producer process inserts things into the buffer
		The consumer process removes things from the buffer
		Unless we're very lucky, there will be problems
