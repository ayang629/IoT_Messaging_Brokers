# IoT_Messaging_Brokers

To come

	- script to run installations/configurations on PI's

	- script to plug in data analysis document

REQUIREMENTS:

	bash - >3

	mosca - 1.*.* (for mosca broker; files should be included in node_modules directory)

	mosquitto - 1.4.* (Either go to mosquitto.org or use brew install mosquitto if you have homebrew)

	mqtt - 3.*.* 

	mqttjs - 1.9.* (files should be already included in node_modules directory)

	nodejs - 4.*.* (go to nodejs.org to install)

	ponte - 0.0.16 (for ponte broker; run npm install ponte bunyan -g to install globally)

	python - 2.7+ (for paho)

	redis - 3.*.* (for mosca/ponte; go to redis.io and download the latest stable version)
		
	other Node-related dependencies are included in the package.json (downloaded into the node_modules folder)

The servers take one of 3 options: mosca, mosquitto, and ponte.
The mosca broker will take whatever information it receives and output it into a data file called mosca_output.txt.
The ponte broker will launch brokers and listen for messages from HTTP, MQTT, and COAP and output data into ponte_output.txt
The mosquitto broker will launch and take whatever information it receives and output data into mosquitto_output.txt

To terminate the server, simply provide a SIGINT (ctrl-c) command, which will trigger a trap to clean up the background 
process (i.e: the redis server).

To run server individually:
	
	$ ./servers.sh [mosquitto | mosca | ponte]

	e.g:

	$ ./servers.sh mosca

	
The clients take one of 3 options: simple (bare-mosquitto calls), mqttjs, and paho. Currently only the mqttjs and simple paho client are implemented. The num_clients argument determines how many clients the clients.sh script will run at once, and the msgs_per_client represents the number of messages each client will attempt to publish. 

To run client experiment:

	First, make sure server script is configured. Then, run the following command

	$ ./experiment.sh conf_file
	
	Options in configuration file:
	
		experiment_type: What type of experiment to run.
		
		num_topics: The number of unique topics to be instantiated.

		publishers_per_topic: How many publishers should be assigned to a given topic.

		msgs_per_topic: How many messages a topic should expect to receive. This number is evenly distributed between clients.

		subscribers_per_topic: The number of clients that will subscribe to a topic

		multipurpose_clients: [yes | no], will tell script to dynamically configure all clients to act as a publisher and a subscriber.

		client_type: Specify what type of client you want to implement

To test different server experiments: (Currently, only the mqttjs clients provide correct experiment output)

	Pure Mosquitto: (Pure, lightweight MQTT broker)

		$ ./servers.sh mosquitto 

		$ ./experiment_driver.sh [experiment_conf]

	Mosca: (MQTT broker in NodeJS)

		$ ./servers.sh mosca

		$ ./experiment_driver.sh [experiment_conf]

	Ponte: (Multiprotocol bridge to handle HTTP and COAP messages)

		$ ./servers.sh ponte

		$ ./servers.sh mosca #This launches the mosca broker on top of ponte

		$ ./experiment_driver.sh [experiment_conf]

To run analysis script on experiment results:

	$ ./processOutput.sh [pubsub | multi] [mosquitto | mosca | ponte] [num_topics] [num_msgs] [subs_per_topic]

	#If you want to just run the throughput experiment individually:

		$ ./process[Server | Client]Throughput.sh [pubsub | multi] [mosca | ponte] [num_topics] [subs_per_topic]

	Details of output (in expResults directory): 
		
		In Latency file (named '[pubsub | multi]Output[num_topics].txt'):

			Packets lost: [True | False]

			"topic avg(ms) min(ms) max(ms) percent_packets_received" --> for each topic

			Total average delay (ms)

		In Server throughput files (named [mosca | ponte]ServerThroughtput.txt, [mosca | ponte]ClientThroughtput.txt):

			Start time (unix timestamp)

			End time (unix timestamp)

			Time elapsed (in milliseconds): end time - start time

			Messages received: total number of messages received by the broker

			Total messages: total number of messages sent by all the clients in a given experiment (derived from num_topics and subs_per_topic)

			Percentage received: percentage of messages that were received by the broker.

			Throughput: average number of messages that reached the broker per second

To clean scripts:

	Cleans all files in multiLogs/ pubLogs/ and subLogs/ automatically. Deletes server output file too

	$ ./cleanLogs.sh [mosca | mosquitto | ponte]


To launch clients in subgroup:

	$ ./clients.sh [simple | mqttjs] [pub | sub | multi] [num_clients] [QoS] [topic] [num_msgs (ONLY IF PUB chosen)]

	e.g: 

	$ ./clients.sh mqttjs pub 50 2 test_topic 1000 1

	$ ./clients.sh mqttjs sub 25 1 test_topic 1
